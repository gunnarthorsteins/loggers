# Loggers

A hobby project from a few years back when I was getting into OOP in Python. Actually liked how it turned out used so it at my old workplace for a while. In the interim I discovered Notion and migrated this sort of stuff over to there.

### High Level Description

There are two functionalities: `worklog` and `exerciselog`.

For the first one the user presses a hotkey which starts a timer. Upon pressing the hotkeys again a GUI pops up which allows the user to type what he was working on. Hit `enter` and it saves it in a table (don't blame me for it being a `.csv`, `SQL` would be an overkill for this! Always think KISS!). I've found this particularly useful when keeping track of hours logged when working in parallel on several different projects as is often the case in small workplaces.

The second one is a nice GUI which allows the user to select from a few different exercise types, type a short comment and then send it away to a 

The last little part is a visualization of both `worklog` and `exerciselog`, showing the running statistics for the last 30 days.

If you're at this point then thank you for reading my gibberish. If you want to try it out and can't get it to work then feel free to reach out!
